## LungCancerDetection

Automatic detection of defects and abnormalities in CT scan images has gained a lot of importance in the recent times as due the deteriorating quality of air almost everyone is facing one or the other type of lung related issues thus it is of esteem importance to study the computed tomography (CT) images of the pulmonary nodules to efficiently treat the diseases like lung cancer. The use of machine learning is an efficient way to distribute the work of doctors and process the large amount of data to produce accurate results on the go. The diagnosis method consists of 3 stages pre-processing of CT images, applying Deep Learning and using Convolutional Neural Network. The pre-processing converts raw data into usable form and deep learning algorithm assigns weight to the data, in the last stage CNN is used to determine the health status of the lung, i.e. normal or abnormal.

### METHODOLOGY ADOPTED

Studying CT scan images is not an easy task it requires a lot of training and expertise in the field, so do machines thus using CT scan images to detect cancer causing cells requires a hefty processing and a clever algorithm to interpret that data and produce results. So to perform this complex task we break down the problem into smaller parts and use 3 different techniques to conquer the problem.

These are:-
* Pre-Processing
* Deep Learning
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
